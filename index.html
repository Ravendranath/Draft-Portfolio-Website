				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					As a student at Sunway University with a passion for finance, I am dedicated to building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will serve me well in my future career. 
                    I am also an active member of Rotaract, where I am able to apply my leadership and teamwork abilities towards making a positive impact in my community.
                    
                    Through my studies in finance, I have developed a keen interest in financial analysis and investment strategies.
                    I am always looking for opportunities to further my understanding of these fields and gain practical experience through internships and networking events.
                    
                    In Rotaract, I have been able to hone my communication and collaboration skills while working on a variety of community service projects.
                    I have gained valuable experience in event planning, fundraising, and outreach, all of which I believe will serve me well in my future career in finance.
                    
                    Overall, I am a motivated and driven individual with a passion for learning and making a difference in my community.
                    I am excited to see where my future in finance and Rotaract will take me, and I am always eager to connect with others who share my interests and values.
